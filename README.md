# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software products.
It is important in that it enables the creation of software products which are used in various aspects of day to day life to make life easier.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a)Development of programming languages e.g python.
b)Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
c)The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)Requirements-collecting user needs and system requirements.
b)Design-creating detailed designs of the architecture and user interface.
c)Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d)Testing-testing if the software meets the quality standards and the functional requirements.
e)Deployment-releasing the software to be used by the users.
f)Maintenance-giving support, updates and enhancing the software as the users use it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall has sequential approach with phases while agile is iterative focusing on flexibility.
Waterfall is suitable where the software has well defined requirements which have to be met while agile is suitable in situations where the projects has evolving requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-writes code and implements software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer-executes tests and plans to ensure software quality.
Project manager-oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality.
IDE-visual studio
VCS-git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements-this may happen during development and may cause delays.it can be avoided by doing research about the user needs before starting the software development process.
Tight deadlines-this may cause development of poor software in terms of quality. it can be avoided by agreeing on reasonable timelines at the beginning of the development process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-testing individual components of software
Integration testing-testing interactions between different components.
System testing-testing the entire software as a whole.
Acceptance testing-testing the software to make sure it meets user needs.
They all help in identifying defects early leading to high quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of giving well defined questions as prompts with the aim of giving it the context in which you need answers from.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
give me examples of AI models
outline various AI platforms that are used in today's world by developers
